Ingredients* 2 cups all-purpose flour* 4 teaspoons baking powder* 1 teaspoon salt* 1 cup milk (or water)* Stew or soup, for cooking and servingSteps to Make ItSHOW IMAGES1. Gather the ingredients.2. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.3. Add the milk or water and mix. The batter should be thick enough to be scooped and dropped from a spoon. Let it rest for a moment.4. Once the boiling stew or soup is nearly done, drop spoonfuls of the batter on top. Be sure that there is plenty of liquid in the pot, but try to keep the dumplings on top of the vegetables and meat.5. Cover and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the dumplings. Do not remove the lid until it is time to check the dumplings; when ready, a toothpick inserted into one of the dumplings should come out clean.6. Once done, spoon the stew or soup with the dumplings into a bowl and enjoy.Tips* Give the dumpling batter time to rest before dropping spoonfuls into the stew or soup. This will allow the baking powder time to activate and will result in a fluffier dumpling.* If you don't have baking powder in your pantry, you can make your own. To get 1 teaspoon of baking powder, mix together 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch.* The dumplings will soak up a lot of broth as they cook, and the flour will thicken it slightly. Make your soup with a little extra liquid to ensure a soupy consistency.* When using a large dinner spoon and a heaping amount of batter, the recipe makes about 12 big dumplings that cover the top of a Dutch oven. Make smaller dumplings if you like.

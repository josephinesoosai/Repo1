Remove and keep it aside.In the same pan, heat some more ghee and fry cashew nuts and raisins separately. Keep it aside.Powder cardamom with a tsp of sugar and keep it ready.Method Boil milk in a heavy bottomed pan, then add the roasted vermicelli to it and cook on medium heat until it becomes soft.

(I used 3.5% fat milk)Then add sugar and stir until it dissolves.Then add cardamom powder, cashew nuts and raisins.Vermicelli kheer is ready to be served. It can be served hot or chilled according to individual preferences.As it cools the kheer will become thick. You can add hot or cold milk to adjust the consistency of the kheer before serving.Tips Ð To make the kheer more tastier, I powdered a little roasted cashew nuts coarsely and added to the kheer while adding the other cashew nuts. This is optional.
